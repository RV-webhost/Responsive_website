For my project üç¶ FrostyTreats ‚Äì Crazy Frozen Treats!, I developed an interactive navigation menu that enhances user experience by changing style on scroll and hover.
Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, I implemented features like dynamic background changes, hover effects, and smooth transitions.

This task helped me:

Explore AI-generated design inspirations and apply them positively to CSS for creative, modern UI styling.

Understand the importance of fixed-position navigation for accessibility and user engagement.
